## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.5.26] - 2026-04-15

## [0.4.4.25] - 2026-03-16

## [0.4.3.24] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- Upgraded xunit to version 3 (#413)

## [0.4.2.23] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- Fixed regex pattern to match and delete appsettings files with double extensions (e.g., `appsettings.Dev.json.br`, `appsettings.Development.json.gz`) which were previously not being detected and deleted (#408)

## [0.4.1.7] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- Brotli and Gzip deletion is not correct (#399)

## [0.4.0.22] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Gzip and Brotli compression support for merged appsettings files. After merging, `.gz` and `.br` versions are automatically created for both `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.{environment}.json` files using System.IO.Compression (#401)

### Fixed

- Only delete Brotli and Gzip files with SettingsFileType.Environment, preserving Primary type compressed files (#399)

## [0.3.4.21] - 2026-02-11

## [0.3.3.20] - 2026-01-16

### Security

- Fixed workflow security issue in test-dependabot.yml by replacing forgeable `github.actor` context value with more secure `github.event.pull_request.user.login` to properly verify Dependabot PRs (SonarQube rule githubactions:S8232) (#348)

## [0.3.2.19] - 2025-12-12

## [0.3.1.18] - 2025-12-11

### Fixed

- Bug with deployment (#324)

### Security

- Fixed command injection vulnerabilities in multiple GitHub Actions workflows by moving user-controlled data to environment variables instead of direct interpolation in run blocks. This affects the following workflows: draft-new-release.yml, blocked-issue.yml, completed-feature-workflow.yml, in-progress-feature-workflow.yml, branch-hotfix.yml, step-push-package.yml, step-tag-release.yml, step-build.yml, and step-version.yml (#315)

## [0.3.0.16] - 2025-11-18

### Changed

- Upgraded all projects and CI/CD pipelines from .NET 8 to .NET 10 (#299)

## [0.2.10.14] - 2025-10-24

### Changed

- Migrated from `thomaseizinger/keep-a-changelog-new-release` to `baynezy/ChangeLogger.Action` (#217)
- Added GH_TOKEN environment variable to all relevant GitHub Action workflows (#222)
- Set up copilot environment (#230)

### Security

- Enhanced security by replacing tag-based GitHub Action references with full commit SHA hashes to prevent supply chain attacks (#243)
- Fixed command injection vulnerability in completed-feature-workflow.yml by using environment variables instead of direct interpolation of user-controlled data (#232)

### Fixed

- Changed lowercase "as" to uppercase "AS" in Dockerfile for SonarQube compliance (#234)
- Made ReplacePath method static in MergeService to address SonarQube rule S2325 (#235)
